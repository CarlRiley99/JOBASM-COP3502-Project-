# JOBASM-COP3502-Project-
This was a semester-long group project for COP3502 (Programming Fundamentals 2).

## Description
JOBASM is a C++ 2-D side scroller shooter game. It has 3 levels and a final boss. The player gets 3 lives and loses 1 life whenever they get hit by an enemy, and immediately loses when they hit a spike. Losing the game causes the player to start all the way back to the first level.

## Concepts that I learned
- Using glfw library to build a game engine from scratch.
- Polymorphism and Class Inheritance.
- How to develop simple Artificial Intelligence that reacts to user behavior.
